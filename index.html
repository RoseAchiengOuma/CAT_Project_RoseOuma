    <p>This is a cover page image of my project<br>
        The project is about a dating app where either mutuals or 
        others can get to know one another more.<br>
        The site enables people to build genuine connections and bonds with one another.
        It also helps bith the male and female to get to understand their types and what 
        interests them in a person.<br>

        on a another. I hope to continue learningmore on how to create my own personal
